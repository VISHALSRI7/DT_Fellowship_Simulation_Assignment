## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my completed assignment for the **DT Fellowship Simulation**, where I stepped into the role of a **Growth Consultant** helping an MSME founder unlock growth through system thinking, reflection, and experimentation.

This wasn’t just a consulting task — it was a challenge to **think like a founder**, design clarity in chaos, and treat data not just as reporting, but as direction.
